 * Helper class to get Injector instances. Slice supports multiple injectors installed on one instance, with
 * each injector being tagged with name of the application that created it. By default, the application name
 * is the name of its folder under /apps.
 * <p/>
 * Injector can be retrieved in two different ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>by specifying injector / application name ({@link #getInjector(String injectorName)}),</li>
 * <li>by specifying resource path for which an injector has been registered (
 * {@link #getInjectorForResource(String resourcePath)}).</li>
 * </ul>
